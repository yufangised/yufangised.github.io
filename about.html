                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Hello, my name is Yufan Wang. I see myself as a multidisciplinary creator, working across technology, design, and art to craft ideas into reality.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        From an <b>EARLY AGE</b>, play for me was mainly about crafting and hacking—making my own toys and experimenting with whatever materials and tools I could find. 
                        At the same time, I dedicated myself to practicing classic Chinese calligraphy and painting, nurturing both skill and an early passion for artistic expression. 
                        Looking back, these childhood experiences planted the seeds for my journey and shaped the way how I create today.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Later, I pursued my <b>EDUCATION</b> in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, completing both BA and MA studies in the field. 
                        This provided me with a strong technical foundation, but during my studies, I discovered a growing passion for design. 
                        So after my master study, I joined a course in Industrial Design, where I gained a deep understanding of design thinking and the design process.
                        I then specialized in Interaction Design, a field where I could merge my technical expertise with a user-centered design approach.
                        Prototyping became my most powerful tool—thinking by making is how I bring ideas to life and test design solutions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My <b>PROFESSIONAL CAREER</b> began as a concept designer in the front-end innovation department at LEGO, where I focused on creating and developing new play experiences for kids. 
                        Working closely with children and observing their creativity and imagination deeply influenced my approach to design, helping me understand the joy and curiosity that drive play. 
                        Over time, playfulness became second nature in my works.
                        In recent years, my role at LEGO has shifted toward hardware innovation, where I explore play potential from a technology-driven approach, 
                        experimenting with new sensory technologies and cutting-edge tools to create immersive, interactive prototypes and experiences. 
                        These projects often bridge the digital and physical worlds, pushing the boundaries of how technology could shape the LEGO paly in the futrue.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>IN PARALLEL</b> with my career at LEGO, I started to explore my long-seeded passion for <b>ART</b>. In 2015, I establish my own art studio-PRESENT INK, 
                        initially experimenting with visual directions in contemporary calligraphy and later discovering my unique visual language through collage making. 
                        This artistic practice has become a vital part of my creative process, feeding back into my other work and inspiring me to seek deeper meaning and aesthetic qualities in everything I create.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Technology, design, and art—these are the three pillars that bring meaning to my creations. 
                        Today, I continue to explore emerging technologies, uncover new design opportunities, and push the boundaries of my art practice. 
                        The future is not certain, but I embrace the unknown, staying open to new possibilities and evolving through my creative journey.

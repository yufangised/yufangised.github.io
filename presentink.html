                        <b>Artist Statement:</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My journey as an artist started when I was a child. 
                        I taught myself classic Chinese calligraphy and painting through self-discipline and years of practice. 
                        This early experience planted a seed for my later career in art, even though I didn’t know it at the time. 
                        In 2013, after I settled in Denmark, this passion for calligraphy resurfaced strongly. 
                        I picked up my brushes again and found myself deeply inspired by how calligraphy evolved since early 20th-century in Asia, blending tradition with modern expression. 
                        This new perspective encouraged me to revisit the traditional techniques I had learned and use them as a foundation to explore my own artistic voice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2015, I set up my art studio-PRESENT INK and started exploring what calligraphy-inspired art could mean for me. 
                        After a few years of experimenting, I found myself with a lot of artwork that didn’t turn out the way I wanted. 
                        At one point, I almost threw them all away, but then a new idea kicked in: why not reuse these materials and make something new? 
                        That’s how I started working with collage.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This collage process became my main way of creating. 
                        It not only keeps my production steady but also brings me constant surprises. 
                        There’s often a natural separation between the art preparation and the final outcome—I stop imagining what the finished piece will look like. 
                        Instead, I focus on finding the desired line quality, which is one of the most important aspects of traditional Chinese calligraphy and painting.
                        I cut my old materials into many pieces and then carefully reassemble them into something new. 
                        During this process, I’ve developed my own techniques and logic. 
                        For example, a perfect coincidence during assembly often sparks my inspiration, and creating visual illusions to trick the eye has become a recurring motif in my work. 
                        Putting the pieces together feels like solving puzzles. 
                        I navigate through many fragments, deciding which ones fit together. 
                        The outcome always has endless possibilities, but only a few pieces survive my screening process. 
                        These final works represent my artistic taste and sensibilities at that moment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over time, I’ve started exploring other materials beyond paper and ink, such as acrylic, plastic, and canvas, to see what new possibilities they bring. 
                        For me, the collaging process works like a formula: I put something in, which sets the tone, but the outcome always surprises me. 
                        This element of surprise not only keeps my work fresh but also keeps me motivated to experiment. 
                        My art practice is about blending tradition with my personal vision and discovering beauty in unexpected places. 
                        As I continue to explore and push the boundaries of this approach, I’m excited to see where it will lead me next.
